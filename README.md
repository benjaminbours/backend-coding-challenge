# Backend Coding Challenge: NestJS Movie API

## Requirements

- Docker
- docker-compose

## How to run the application

`docker-compose up`

## What are the endpoints and what does this API allow me to do?

After you started the application, go to [this url](http://localhost:3000/api)

## What if I want to test with Postman?

When you start the application, a `swagger.json` file is generated. You can then import it easily in Postman as a collection.

Base url should be `http://localhost:3000`
